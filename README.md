# Self-driving car

This is an AI project using fuzzy logic and fuzzy systems.

## What is this project briefly?

In this project we have 3 inputs as 3 sensors that each give us the distances from left, right and from the front of our car. first we fuzzify our crisp inputs using diagram of each fuzzy variable (that is given to us), then we inference based on the memberships of our variables and the rules that we've been given, and in the end we defuzzify using center of gravity method to output the crisp amount that we can apply and use in the action.

## How to run

In order to be able to see the output, if you do not have the pygame library installed on your system, you must install it with the following command:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
and to run the project use this command:
```bash
python simulator.py
```
